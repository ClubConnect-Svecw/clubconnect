Required Software Files List :

1.	Download and Install Java from Oracle.
2.	Install Android studio IDE.
3.	Install SDK platform tools.
4.	Download Sqlite database Browser

Project Files List :

1.	AndroidManifest.xml

This XML file describes to the Android platform what your application can do.
It is a required file, and is the mechanism you use to show your application
to the user (in the app launcher's list), handle data types, etc.


2.	src/*

In src, you will have java files, resource files and assets required to implement the project

Java - src/main/java/package/.java

These java files are used to implement the user experience design and the actual backend logic.

Resource files - src/main/res/* - under this directory we have resources of our application.

The res contains layout files, values, and drawable files.
The res/layout/ directory contains xml files describing user interface
              The res/drawable/ directory contains images and other things that can be
              drawn to the screen.  These can be bitmaps (in .png or .jpeg format) or
              special XML files describing more complex drawings. 
res/values/colors.xml
res/values/strings.xml
res/values/styles.xml
These XML files describe additional resources included in the application.
They all use the same syntax; all of these resources could be defined in one
file, but we generally split them apart as shown here to keep things organized.
